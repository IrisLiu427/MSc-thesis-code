''' Network analysis starts from two code files.
    The first one is called 'NetworkBuilding.pyâ€™.
    It is used for constructing networks with only kinase nodes are weighted(weighted by sum of shared PDTs with all neighbor kinases).
    
    The other one is called 'EdgeWeightedNetworkBuilding.py'.
    This file builds networks with also the edges are weighted(weighted by shared kinase PDTs in each two kinase pairs).
